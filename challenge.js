// Loop Challenge: FizzBuzz Lite
// Instructions: Print numbers from 1 to 20 with the following rules:
// - If the number is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz".
// - If the number is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz".
// - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
// - Otherwise, print the number itself.

//  Hints to Get Started:
// 1️⃣ Create a for loop that runs from 1 to 20.
// 2️⃣ Inside the loop, check if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 first.
// 3️⃣ If it's not, check if it's divisible by only 3 or only 5.
// 4️⃣ Use console.log() to print the correct output for each number.
